# XamarinWearableApp

I was going to create a simple stopwatch and timer app for my Samsung watch but as I was about to start, I updated my watch and the two apps came with the update. I then thought quickly and decided to create a Qoute of the Day app which connects to an api to stream a quote to my watch every day.

When you turn on the app, it connects to the api, streams the data to the watch, and is then deserialized into a Quote object. Once the Quote is created, it is shown on the screen in two views, one for the quote, and one for the Author's Name.

This has been incredibly useful in understanding how to connect to an api and stream information from the internet and has also helped further my knowledge in mobile and wearable app based development.
